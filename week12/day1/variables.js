//variables
//variables are used to store data
//variables are like containers
//variables can store different types of data
//variables can be changed
//variables can be used in calculations

var name = "john"; //defining a variable
console.log(name); //displaying the value of a variable

name = "jane"; //changing the value of a variable
console.log(name);


var age= 25;
console.log(age);
age=30;
console.log(age);

let city = "New York";
console.log(city);

//naming conveNtions

var total= 100;
var total2= 340;
var tot3al= 500;


//var 4total= 100; //invalid. a variable name cannot start with a number

//var first name= "john"; //invalid. a variable name cannot have a space


//var total@= 100; //invalid. a variable name cannot have a special character except for underscore

var first_name= "john"; //valid. a variable name can have an underscore
var firstName= "john"; //valid. a variable name can have camel case

var Price='100'; //valid but not recommended. a variable name should start with a lowercase letter
